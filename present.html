      <h1>🌍 Earth Today: A Delicate Balance</h1>
      <p>
        The 21st-century Earth is both astonishing and alarming. It spins with vibrancy — forests breathe, rivers flow, cities hum — yet beneath the surface lies a silent battle. 
        Every choice we make today writes the story future generations will inherit.

        <h2>🌲 Nature’s Wonders: Resilience in Motion</h2>
        <p>
          Earth’s ecosystems continue to amaze — from the Amazon rainforest's oxygen-producing canopy to coral reefs shimmering with biodiversity.
          Despite climate stress and encroachment, many of these wonders fight to survive. Their resilience is our inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          🌐 <strong>Did you know?</strong> Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support over 25% of marine life. Yet, over <strong>50% of reefs are dead or dying</strong> due to warming waters.

        <h2>🏙️ Human Footprint: Progress with a Price</h2>
        <p>
          Skyscrapers rise. Highways stretch. Factories produce. Humanity has built a powerful world — but at a cost. Our cities consume over 75% of global resources, leaving scars in the form of deforestation, emissions, and noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022, the global population crossed <strong>8 billion</strong>. That’s 8 billion dreams — but also 8 billion footprints on our fragile Earth.

        <p>
          Glaciers are vanishing. Oceans are rising. Wildfires now rage in once-temperate zones. Earth’s climate is spiraling, with record heatwaves scorching cities and unpredictable rains flooding coasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the UN, we have less than <strong>7 years</strong> to prevent irreversible damage. This isn't a warning — it's an alarm bell.

        <p>
          Across the globe, hope rises — solar fields replace coal mines, electric vehicles zoom silently, youth activists fill the streets. Innovation is our strongest ally.
        </p>
        <p>
          From green architecture to biodegradable packaging, humans are proving we can adapt. But it requires unity, urgency, and bold leadership.

    <h2>🌊 Beneath the Blue: Underwater Ecosystems in Peril</h2>
    <p>
      Earth’s oceans are the planet’s lungs, regulating temperature and producing over half the world’s oxygen. From vibrant coral reefs to deep-sea trenches, underwater ecosystems are marvels of biodiversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But today, this hidden world faces unprecedented threats. Plastic pollution, overfishing, oil spills, and ocean acidification are choking marine life. Coral bleaching events are becoming more frequent due to rising ocean temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      🌐 <strong>Did you know?</strong> An estimated <strong>11 million metric tons</strong> of plastic enter our oceans each year — that's about one truckload every minute.

    <h2>🌫️ The Air We Breathe: A Growing Concern</h2>
    <p>
      Clean air is vital for health and survival, yet urban skylines across the globe are increasingly blurred by smog and toxic emissions. Industrial output, fossil fuels, and deforestation contribute to dangerous levels of air pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Airborne particulates cause respiratory illnesses, reduce life expectancy, and contribute to climate change. Children and elderly populations are especially vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      🌐 <strong>Did you know?</strong> According to WHO, <strong>99% of the global population</strong> breathes air that exceeds safe pollution limits.
