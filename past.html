        <p>Earth’s past is a story of simplicity, balance, and harmony with nature. Long before cities, 
            factories, and vehicles existed, the planet was greener, cleaner, and full of natural life. People 
            lived in close connection with the Earth especially through farming and nature-based living.</p>

        <h1>Earth's Early Days</h1>
        <img src="volcano.gif" alt="Volcanic erruption" style="width: 300px;border-radius: 20px;">
        <p>Over 4.5 billion years ago, Earth was formed. After cooling, the oceans and atmosphere formed, and the planet 
            became suitable for life. Over time, plants, trees, and forests covered the land, creating a rich green 
            environment.In the early days, Earth was a lush paradise. The air was clean, the water pure, and the land teemed with life. 
            The first humans lived in harmony with nature, relying on the land for food and shelter.</p>
        <p>
       <p>🌿Forests spread across continents. Rivers flowed clean. Air and water were pure.</p>

        <p>In the past, especially before industrialization, farming was not just a job it was a way of life, 
            deeply rooted in tradition and family. Most people lived in peaceful villages surrounded by lush greenery 
            vast fields of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and vegetables. They grew only what they needed, using natural methods 
            and working in harmony with the land. Cows and bulls were trusted companions, helping to plow the soil. There were 
            no harmful chemicals; instead, farmers used organic fertilizers like cow dung and compost. Food was always fresh, 
            wholesome, and local a true gift from the earth.</p>
       <p>🌾 Farming wasn’t just a job it was a way of life, passed down through generations.</p>

        <img src="clean earth.gif" alt="clean" style="width: 300px;border-radius: 20px;">
        <p>Before the rise of factories, plastic, and fuel-based vehicles, the Earth was truly green and clean. Pollution was minimal, 
            allowing the air to remain fresh, the skies to stay clear, and rivers to flow pure and undisturbed. Trees and plants 
            flourished in every corner, playing a vital role in maintaining nature’s delicate balance. Birds, butterflies, and animals 
            lived freely alongside humans, creating a peaceful coexistence where life thrived in harmony with the environment.</p>

        <img src="peace.gif" alt="peace" style="width: 300px;border-radius: 20px;">
        <p>Life in the past was simple, meaningful, and cost-effective. People built their homes using mud, wood, and other natural 
            materials, living in tune with their surroundings. They relied on sunlight during the day and used firewood or oil lamps to 
            light their homes at night with little need for electricity or fuel. Clothes were handwoven from natural cotton, made 
            with care and purpose. Needs were few, waste was minimal, and everything had value. True happiness came not from money or 
            machines, but from family, farming, festivals, and the beauty of nature that surrounded them.</p>

        <p>People once lived in harmony with nature — waking up with the sun, working gently in the fields, and resting as the sun 
            went down. There was no rush, no stress, and no screens — only the soothing sounds of birds singing, leaves rustling in 
            the breeze, and children laughing as they played under the shade of trees. Life followed the rhythm of the Earth. Festivals 
            were joyful celebrations of nature 🌕, folk songs and stories carried wisdom passed down through generations 🎶, and above 
            all, there was deep respect for Mother Earth 🌏, who provided everything with quiet grace.</p>
